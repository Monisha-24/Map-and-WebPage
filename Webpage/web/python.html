        <div>My first preference is Python.
        *I love studying and coding in Python.
        *Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.
        *Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes.
        *It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming.
        *Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.</div>
